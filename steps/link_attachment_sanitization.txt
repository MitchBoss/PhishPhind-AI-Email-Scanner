[STEP_PROMPT]
Using the attachments and embedded URLs extracted in `email_parsing_output`, list all URLs and attachments as found. For URLs, note their visible text and the actual URL if available.

**Tasks:**
- List all URLs with their visible text and extracted destinations.
- Note any anomalies (e.g., shortened or obfuscated URLs).
