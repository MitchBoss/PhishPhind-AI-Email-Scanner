Email Parsing

[STEP_PROMPT]
Using the full raw email provided as `message_content`, identify if the email is forwarded. Look for forwarding indicators such as:
- “Fwd:” or “FW:” in the subject line,
- “Forwarded message” text in the headers or body,
- Additional “From/Date/Subject/To” lines in the body that indicate a forwarded chain.

If the email is forwarded:
1. Locate the earliest/original email within the chain. (This is typically the last “-----Original Message-----” or similar block in the chain.)
2. Extract the components (headers, subject, from details, body, attachments, and embedded URLs) **only from that earliest/original email**.
3. Ignore or exclude any wrapper content added by the forwarder (e.g., the forwarder’s notes or signature).

If the email is not forwarded:
- Proceed normally, extracting the components from the single email.

**Extract the following components from the original email** (the earliest one, if forwarded):
- **Email Headers:** Include sender IP, metadata, routing information, and all header fields from the original email only.
- **Subject:** The subject of the original email, omitting any “Fwd:” or “FW:” or similar forwarding text.
- **From Details:** From Name, sender email address, and Reply-To address from the original email only.
- **Message Body:** Plain text and HTML versions of the original email only, excluding any forwarding notes or appended text from the forwarder.
- **Attachments:** All attachments from the original email only.
- **Embedded URLs:** Any URLs within the original email only.

**Tasks:**
- Identify if it is a forwarded email and locate the earliest email in the chain.
- Extract the original email headers, subject, from details, message body, attachments, and embedded URLs.
- Omit any forwarder’s notes, signature, or subject line additions.
