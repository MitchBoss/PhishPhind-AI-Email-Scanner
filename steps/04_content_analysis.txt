Content Analysis

[STEP_PROMPT]
Using the outputs from `email_parsing_output`, `link_attachment_analysis_output`, and `sender_header_analysis_output`, analyze the overall purpose or intent of the original email (If email was forwarded, ignore this and assess the original email.). Evaluate:
- The primary message or call-to-action of the email.
- Whether the email’s stated purpose aligns with the sender's claimed identity, subject, and the characteristics of its embedded links and attachments.
- Any discrepancies between the sender's identity (as determined from the headers, subject, and body) and the nature of the links/attachments.
- Whether it makes contextual sense to receive this email from the sender (for example, if the sender's domain does not logically correspond with the email's subject or purpose).
- Flag any ambiguous or suspicious cues that warrant manual review.
- If the email has been forwarded, ignore this and just make assessment on the orgiginal email.
