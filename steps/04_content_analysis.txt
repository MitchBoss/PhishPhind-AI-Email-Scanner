Content Analysis

[STEP_PROMPT]
Using the outputs from `email_parsing_output`, `link_attachment_analysis_output`, and `sender_header_analysis_output`, analyze **only the original email** (earliest in the chain, ignoring forwarder’s notes). Focus on:
- The primary message or call-to-action.
- Whether the email’s purpose aligns with the sender’s claimed identity, subject, and links/attachments.
- Discrepancies in identity vs. content.
- Contextual sense of receiving this from that sender.
- Any suspicious cues.

email_parsing_output: " {email_parsing_output} "
link_attachment_analysis_output: " {link_attachment_analysis_output} "
sender_header_analysis_output: " {sender_header_analysis_output} "

**Tasks:**
1. Identify the overall purpose or intent of the original email.
2. Evaluate if the email’s intent is consistent with the claimed sender identity, subject, and links/attachments.
3. Check if it makes sense that the recipient would get this email from that sender.
4. Note discrepancies or suspicious cues.
5. Provide an assessment of clarity vs. potential deception, and recommend manual review if needed.
