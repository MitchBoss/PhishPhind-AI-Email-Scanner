Content Evaluation

[STEP_PROMPT]
Using the email body extracted in `email_parsing_output` (or directly from `message_content` if necessary), analyze the content for objective markers. Focus on clearly identifiable elements such as:
- Presence of urgent or threatening phrases.
- Requests for sensitive information.
- Use of generic greetings or lack of personalization.

Do not perform subjective interpretation beyond what is directly observable. If any markers appear ambiguous, flag that manual review is advised.

**Tasks:**
- Identify urgent/threatening phrases in the content.
- List any requests for sensitive information.
- Note the presence of generic or non-personalized greetings.
- Flag if any indicators are ambiguous and suggest manual review.
