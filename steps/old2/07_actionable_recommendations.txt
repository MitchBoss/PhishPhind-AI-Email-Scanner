Actionable Recommendations

[STEP_PROMPT]

**Tasks:**
- Highlight the most critical objective issues identified.
- Suggest manual investigation steps for any ambiguous or borderline indicators.
- Recommend precautionary measures (e.g., refrain from clicking on links) based on the risk level.
- Advise on reporting procedures to IT security if malicious indicators are confirmed.
