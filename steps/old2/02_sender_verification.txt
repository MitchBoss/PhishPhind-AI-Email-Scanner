Sender Verification

[STEP_PROMPT]
Using the sender details extracted in `email_parsing_output`, review the sender's email address and domain as provided in the headers. Note any obvious discrepancies (e.g., misspellings or mismatches) and extract the SPF/DKIM verification results from the header content. Also, include a note that if further external verification is needed (e.g., WHOIS lookup or threat intelligence review), the analyst should perform those manually.

**Tasks:**
- List the sender's email address and domain from `email_parsing_output`.
- Extract and report the SPF/DKIM verification results.
- Note any discrepancies in the domain (e.g., misspellings or mismatches).
- Indicate if the sender appears to use a free email service.
- Include a note recommending manual checks (such as WHOIS lookup) if uncertainty remains.
