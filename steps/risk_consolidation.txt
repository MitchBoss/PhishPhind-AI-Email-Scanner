Risk Consolidation

[STEP_PROMPT]
Using the outputs from `sender_verification_output`, `content_evaluation_output`, `link_attachment_sanitization_output`, and `contextual_correlation_output`, aggregate and consolidate the objective findings to assign an overall risk level to the email. Apply these guidelines:
- Heavily weight clear, benign indicators (e.g., consistent sender data, valid header information, known legitimate URLs) to lower the risk score.
- Flag the email only if multiple objective red flags are present.
- If the risk score is borderline, note that additional manual verification is recommended using the analyst playbook.

**Tasks:**
- Aggregate key objective findings from each output.
- Identify and list objective red flags.
- Describe how benign indicators reduce the overall risk.
- Assign an overall risk level (High/Medium/Low).

sender_verification_output: " {sender_verification_output} "
content_evaluation_output: " {content_evaluation_output} "
link_attachment_sanitization_output: " {link_attachment_sanitization_output} "
contextual_correlation_output: " {contextual_correlation_output} "
