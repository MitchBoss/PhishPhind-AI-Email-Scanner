Link & Attachment Analysis

[STEP_PROMPT]
Using the attachments and embedded URLs from `message_content`, analyze the links and attachments for phishing indicators. Focus on:
- Listing all detected URLs along with their visible text.
- Attempting to decode encoded or obfuscated URLs to reveal their real destination. If decoding fails, retain the original URL.
- Listing attachments with file names and file types.
- Recommending manual verification for any uncertain or suspicious links or attachments.

message_content: " {message_content} "

**Tasks:**
- List all detected URLs with their visible text.
- List the full URLs. If for example it's clear that the link will forward to another url such as outlook safelinks protection, output the forwarded URL.
- List all attachments with file names and types.
- Recommend manual verification if any links or attachments appear suspicious.
