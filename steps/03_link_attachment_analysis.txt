Link & Attachment Analysis

[STEP_PROMPT]
Using the original email’s attachments and embedded URLs (from `email_parsing_output`), analyze for phishing indicators:
- List each detected URL and its visible text (if available).
- Attempt to decode or resolve short/obfuscated URLs; if uncertain, keep the original.
- List all attachments from the original email, ignoring any that appear in forwarder’s notes.
- Recommend manual verification if links or attachments are suspicious.

message_content: " {message_content} "

**Tasks:**
1. Identify and list all URLs from the original email (earliest in the chain).
2. If a URL uses a redirect or shortener, attempt to decode. If uncertain, retain the original.
3. List all attachments with file names and types from the original email only.
4. Recommend manual verification for suspicious or unknown links/attachments.
