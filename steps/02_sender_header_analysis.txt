Sender & Header Analysis

[STEP_PROMPT]
Using the output from email_parsing_output, analyze the sender's details and email header information from the original email. If the email is forwarded, ensure that only the original, earliest email's headers and content are used for analysis, and ignore any additional headers or forwarding artifacts. Analyze the email body and subject to determine the claimed identity. Focus on:
- Extracting the sender's email address, domain, and the display name (i.e., who the sender is purporting to be from the original headers).
- Extracting the subject of the original email.
- Analyzing the email body and subject to identify any claims regarding the sender's identity.
- Verifying if the claimed identity in the email body and subject matches the header details.
- Checking SPF/DKIM verification results (if available). If the headers do not include SPF/DKIM information, output "Not Applicable" (this does not necessarily indicate a failure).
- Identifying discrepancies or anomalies (e.g., misspellings, domain mismatches, free email service usage, or mismatches between the header and body/subject claimed identity).
- Recommending manual verification (e.g., WHOIS lookup) if necessary.

email_parsing_output: " {email_parsing_output} "

**Tasks:**
- List the sender's email address, domain, and display name as extracted from the original email headers.
- Extract the subject from the original email.
- Analyze and extract the claimed identity from the email body and subject and from name.
- Report SPF/DKIM verification results, outputting "Not Applicable" if no SPF/DKIM information is present.
- Compare the claimed identity from the email body, from address and subject with the header information and indicate whether there are any discrepancies that indicate the from address doesn't match the claimed identity.
- Note any discrepancies or anomalies.
- Indicate if a free email service is used.
- Recommend if this is likely to be phishing or if manual verification if needed.
