Sender & Header Analysis

[STEP_PROMPT]
Using the output from `email_parsing_output`, analyze only the **original email** (earliest in any forwarded chain).  
- Focus on the sender's details (email address, domain, display name) from the original headers.
- Extract the subject of the original email.
- Analyze the email body and subject to identify the claimed identity (e.g., “Facebook Team,” “NGOs1,” etc.).
- Verify if the claimed identity in the body/subject matches the header details.
- Check SPF/DKIM results if available; otherwise, output "Not Applicable."
- Identify discrepancies (domain mismatches, free email service usage, or mismatches between the header and body/subject identity).
- Recommend manual verification if suspicious.

email_parsing_output: " {email_parsing_output} "

3. Identify the claimed identity in the body/subject and compare it with the From/Reply-To addresses.
4. Report SPF/DKIM if available; otherwise, "Not Applicable."
5. Note discrepancies or anomalies that suggest potential phishing.
6. Indicate if the domain is a free email service.
7. Provide a recommendation regarding phishing suspicion or the need for manual checks.
